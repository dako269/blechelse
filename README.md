# blechelse

This project aims to mimic the automated passenger information announcements at German railway stations operated by Deutsche Bahn and uses data provided by [marudor.de](https://marudor.de) for that.  

blechelse requires the "espeak-ng" binary to be present in its default configuration. To run, simply execute the php script `app.php` and append the name of a station you want the announcements for.
